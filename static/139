			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Jennifer Gresham at <a href="http://www.everydaybright.com" target="_blank">Everyday Bright</a>.</h6>
<p>You feel like you&#8217;ve tried everything. You set something outside with the garbage, but find it back inside the house because your spouse couldn&#8217;t bear parting with it. Or you plead for help with clearing the clutter, only to have what was supposed to be a guest room transform into a storage area.</p>
<p>You crave a more minimalist home, but not at the expense of your marriage. You&#8217;ve resigned yourself that living with all that stuff is simply the price you pay for love.</p>
<p>Or maybe convincing them to part with it is easier than you think &#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved my husband&#8217;s sentimental nature. I think it&#8217;s sweet he stored our hastily scrawled love notes and considers saving gifts from family an act of loyalty (yes, even the wind-up sushi and 4 foot long Spanish sword). Of course, he&#8217;s also kept early drawings of airplanes and his high school Letterman&#8217;s jacket.</p>
<p>I came to minimalism late in life and goodness knows I still have a long way to go. But as the girl who consigned her wedding gown, I thought I could help him see the benefit of reducing our material burden. I reminded him of all the clutter we never used, yet found ourselves trapped into keeping; I hinted at the money we could earn by selling those things on Craigslist. At times, I&#8217;m ashamed to admit, I called his reluctance silly.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, those somewhat confrontational introductions to minimalism didn&#8217;t go well. The key wasn&#8217;t just being more delicate, though that certainly helped. As Chip and Dan Heath explain in their book <em>Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard</em>, to persuade your family or anyone else to embrace a new idea, you must appeal to both their minds and their hearts.<span id="more-7306"></span></p>
<h3>5 strategies to make minimalism a joint venture</h3>
<p><strong>1. Bring in an outside expert</strong>. Maybe this has happened to you: your spouse gives you some advice, about your job or your family, but you don&#8217;t believe it until someone else tells you <em>the same thing</em>. I don&#8217;t quite know why this happens, but this phenomena can complicate your family efforts with minimalism as well.</p>
<p>In the spirit of leveraging this built-in bias, I let my husband borrow my copy of Chris Guillebeau&#8217;s <em>The Art of Nonconformity</em>. I didn&#8217;t introduce it as a text on minimalism (it isn&#8217;t), just an inspiring read. Before I knew it, my husband was telling <em>me</em> how reducing our material footprint would give us more flexibility in everything from housing choices to travel plans.</p>
<p>Find a book on a subject your spouse already wants to read, but also speaks to the general principles of minimalism. For example, if your spouse loves sailing, try a true story about someone who sold all their belongings to sail around the world.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a purgatory for your stuff</strong>. For you, probably nothing&#8217;s quite as joyful as watching the garbage truck turn the corner with ten bags of your former possessions. But if your spouse is still on the fence, that scenario sounds more like a nightmare.</p>
<p>Decluttering in steps takes the edge off. In our case, we designated our garage as our &#8220;purgatory.&#8221; Anything that stayed there without being missed for more than 3 months could safely be removed. If someone really wanted it, the item could move back in.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re short on storage space, try finding a &#8220;foster home&#8221; for your things. Maybe a friend needs a stereo or a frying pan&#8211;let him borrow yours until your spouse feels comfortable making it a gift. The point is to make the first decision reversible, which reduces the fear factor and allows the emotional side of the brain to ease into the decision (while still removing the item from the house).</p>
<p><strong>3. Lead by example</strong>. I&#8217;m a modest person and have never been a fan of &#8220;I love me&#8221; walls boasting diplomas or awards. But the Outstanding Educator award I earned at the Air Force Academy is special&#8211;I actually cried when I won it. So when I decided to toss the bust and plaque, that got my husband&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>Determine what truly motivates your spouse&#8217;s hoarding. Is it guilt, nostalgia, or just laziness? Demonstrate how your spouse might bypass those issues without making a big deal of it. In my case, I told him I realized I didn&#8217;t need the physical object to feel the pride it represented, which triggered my husband&#8217;s own revelation that clinging to his childhood memorabilia was likewise unrelated to the happy memories they held for him.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be happy</strong>. I&#8217;m a lucky woman; making me happy seems to be one of my husband&#8217;s life goals. And without a doubt, eliminating items from our house makes me happy&#8211;for several minutes at least. Too often, however, I focused on everything we still had to sort and discard instead of celebrating our steady success.</p>
<p>Expressing the joy of less is the secret weapon in your efforts to share minimalism. You can approach it directly by putting your happiness into words, or you can demonstrate your improved mood in more subtle ways. For example, you could invite your spouse to an impromptu dance in the living room, explaining &#8220;Look at all this room!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Believe</strong>. Addressing our extensive CD collection was the hardest for us. We admitted we almost always listened to music from our iPod. The problem was that we had <em>hundreds </em>of CDs that weren&#8217;t yet in our online library.</p>
<p>Although I initially volunteered to tackle the daunting project of converting the music, I never found the energy to begin. I suggested we either give away the discs and lose the uncataloged music, or resign ourselves to keeping the collection. To my surprise and delight, my husband provided the best alternative: he&#8217;d rip CDs every night as he surfed the internet.</p>
<p>I told him how proud I was of his initiative. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be too proud,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;All I&#8217;ve done is put them on the computer. We haven&#8217;t gotten rid of those CDs yet.&#8221; But with the stereo system already in purgatory and over 100 CDs captured, I felt good. I hugged him and said, &#8220;I believe in you.&#8221; And I do.</p>
<p>Take a cue from other change management programs, like Weight Watchers and Alcoholics Anonymous, and be that base of support for your spouse. Sometimes, having someone who believes in your ability to succeed can be inspirational enough to make it happen.</p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>At some point, you had an epiphany. Maybe when you had to move and you just couldn&#8217;t believe how many boxes your stuff required. Or maybe you woke up one day and said, &#8220;Enough is enough.&#8221; And once you knew what you wanted, or in this case didn&#8217;t want, you were eager to make it happen.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t convince someone else to have an epiphany. They have to come to it on their own. The more you push, the more resistance you create. Enticing your spouse to follow you to a happier life, not escape an unpleasant one, is the goal.</p>
<p>Remember how you felt when the two of you first met? You probably thought you could subsist on love alone. Here&#8217;s the secret: you can. You just have to remember how.</p>
<p>Now hurry. Go clean house.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This is a guest post from Benny the Irish polyglot of <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com">Fluent in 3 months</a>.</h6>
<p>When I was 21 years old, the only language I spoke was English. I had done quite poorly in languages in school and believed that I was too untalented and even too &#8216;old&#8217; to consider ever speaking a foreign language, even basically.</p>
<p>Now seven years later I speak eight languages fluently and can get by quite well in several others. In my day-to-day life I almost never speak English and my travels and scope of friendships have been greatly enriched because of this.</p>
<p>How I reached this stage was not by studying a lot or investing thousands in software or courses. It was by applying the simple principles outlined here.<span id="more-7088"></span></p>
<h2>Having the right learning approach</h2>
<p>What mostly surprises people is my confidence that anyone can reach a high level of fluency in a language in just a few months. Many of us will have studied a language for years in school and are barely able to string a sentence together, so this idea might sound nothing short of arrogant.</p>
<p>However, considering what you are actually doing in school; a couple of hours of theory, using the language unnaturally for exam purposes, and some half-interested homework – this barely adds up to a few weeks of real work even over half a decade.</p>
<p>After just two months living in Budapest, with no previous exposure to the language, I was ready to be interviewed entirely in Hungarian on video. I am not smarter or more talented than anyone else who might attempt this, but I am much more committed and serious about reaching my goals.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to devote your life to the language, but you must invest at least an hour a day, ideally more, which involves <em>focused </em>use of the language.</p>
<p>Casual interest can only get you so far – if you just &#8216;want&#8217; to speak a language, that gives you no edge. Who wouldn&#8217;t want that? To make real progress, that want has to become a <em>need</em>.</p>
<p>With focus and your full attention you can learn much quicker</p>
<p>And there is only one way the language will become a true necessity: you need to start speaking it with other people, <em>now</em>.</p>
<h3>Stop learning the language, and start speaking it!</h3>
<p>If I had to summarize what definitely separates those who fail in attempts to reach conversational fluency and those who succeed, based on my experience of meeting thousands of language learners, it is simply the fact that the latter group actually use the language. Not for exams, not for listening to podcasts or reading, but to communicate with human beings.</p>
<p>If your goal is to be able to read perfectly or understand the radio perfectly, then lots of reading and listening will be precisely what you need.</p>
<p>However, to speak well, you need to speak often! You can&#8217;t avoid this, it&#8217;s kind of the whole point!</p>
<p>Seriously, stop studying the target language so much! A language can&#8217;t be treated like a subject in school such as history or biology; in the real world you cannot &#8216;fail&#8217; when you make a certain number of mistakes. Other people are very helpful when you are genuinely trying to speak with them.</p>
<p>People told me that in Berlin I would find it hard to convince Germans to not speak English to me all the time, but even when I was initially struggling they would be very helpful and patient with me as I spoke. They could see that I was serious about speaking their language and rewarded me for my efforts.</p>
<p>I can assure you, if you start speaking now with the little you know, you will indeed make mistakes but other speakers and natives will forgive you for this and you will realize that you always had the ability to communicate and get your point across.</p>
<p>Thanks to this practice, any studying you do will be focused on real use of the language relevant to your life, rather than theoretical applications recommended in generic courses.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t wait to finish the course – take matters into your own hands!</h3>
<p>What so many courses miss is that no matter how much you study, unless you start to use the language with others on a regular basis, it will have no real context in your mind and it&#8217;s very hard to make any real progress.</p>
<p>I know people who are like walking dictionaries – they know the most obscure words in the foreign language and can explain precisely how the grammar works. And yet they are <em>still </em>not confident enough to speak.</p>
<p>One of these was another foreigner I lived with in Spain who could run circles around me if you put the two of us in an examination. Despite this, Spaniards I met when we were together would tell me that I spoke much better than he did. I wasn&#8217;t thinking too much about saying things perfectly – I just let the conversations flow.</p>
<p>People focused on perfection still need to learn &#8216;just a little more&#8217; and they&#8217;ll be ready &#8217;some day&#8217;. There are seven days in a week and &#8217;some day&#8217; isn&#8217;t one of them!</p>
<p>Those with much less theory behind them, but more experience actually speaking, will outdo the academics every time. This has <em>nothing to do with natural talent</em>, it&#8217;s about simply opening your mouth and really using the language.</p>
<p>A language is a means of communication. If you think of it as a list of vocabulary to learn off, or a table of grammar to memorize, you are missing the point entirely.</p>
<p>When you start practicing, you will improve on your speaking skills dramatically. It won&#8217;t be easy, but once you accept that you simply cannot skip the stage of making mistakes and try to enjoy it, then the mistakes will disappear quicker.</p>
<h3>You don&#8217;t need to travel to speak the language</h3>
<p>Successful language learners don&#8217;t aim to speak well <em>some day</em> &#8211; they use it <em>now</em>. Make all of your focus on immediate use of the language. Study can help, but it is most effective when it has immediate applications.</p>
<p>Find natives and other learners to practice with and arrange to meet up with them immediately. It will be hard at first, but you need real pressure if you want to make real progress.</p>
<p>Rather than downloading podcasts and buying too many courses, meet up with actual people and use the language! A few resources I like to use include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a> for language meet-ups in major cities. You can also read advertisements in newspapers and your local library to see if people meet up interested in speaking the language you want to.</li>
<li>Join <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">Couchsurfing</a> and host foreign travelers in your home. The same site also has international meetings and a feature to search your city for people who speak a particular language.</li>
<li>You can also find native speakers online and practice over Skype, through many language learning social networks available for free	online.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this in your home town.</p>
<p>The only reason I feel that travel really does make a difference for some people is because of the pressure to perform being constantly there.</p>
<p>But many expats still waste the opportunity. I met a man who had been living in Prague for <em>ten</em> years and still didn&#8217;t speak any Czech, even though his own children did. He had created a bubble of his mother tongue that &#8216;protected&#8217; him via his social circle and routines.</p>
<p>If he can do this in a foreign country, why can&#8217;t we do it from home with a foreign language? You don&#8217;t have to avoid your mother tongue (that is not a realistic solution for many due to work and family / friends), but you can create a &#8216;bubble&#8217; where everything you do is in the target language, even if just for that hour a day.</p>
<h3>A positive attitude is the key</h3>
<p>No matter what language I learn, I always try to look at my cup as &#8216;half full&#8217;. It&#8217;s possible to answer this post with a list of reasons why learning a given language would be too hard for you, but this bogus focus on excuses is what actually makes it hard for many people.</p>
<p>You can also make it easy by deciding to have a positive attitude accompany you in your language learning journey.</p>
<p>This positive attitude creates a feedback loop in your mind where you will look for more evidence to support the idea that it isn&#8217;t that bad after all and this will further fuel your openness to learn more without creating any invisible barriers. Progress will flow and you&#8217;ll be speaking confidently before you know it.</p>
<p>So stop reading about it, stop listening to others doing it, and stop over-studying and dreaming about &#8217;some day&#8217;. It&#8217;s time to get out there and speak it!</p>

<p>I am overjoyed.</p>
<p>Zen Habits has just finished its 4th year of existence and every year has been better than the last. This year has been no exception.</p>
<p>How great a year has it been? Zen Habits grew from 150,000 subscribers to well over 200,000 and topped TIME magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1999770_1999761,00.html">Top 25 blogs for 2010</a> (after also making it in 2009).</p>
<p>But the joy has gone beyond numbers &#8212; for me both professionally and personally:</p>
<ul>
<li>I finished and self-published my new book <a href="http://focusmanifesto.com">focus</a> and it has done exceedingly well.</li>
<li>I moved my family from Guam to San Francisco and <a href="http://zenhabits.net/notes-from-san-francisco/">have been loving it here</a> in this beautiful city.</li>
<li>We gave up our automobile completely for the first time and truly love the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/car-free/">car-free life</a>.</li>
<li>I lost more weight at the beginning of the year and am fitter slimmer and healthier than ever. By far.</li>
<li>I completely eliminated ads here on Zen Habits and rely entirely on my lovely readers and on <a href="http://zenhabits.net/books/">selling my own stuff</a>.</li>
<li>I also removed photos from Zen Habits. Some of you have expressed regret that the photos are gone and I understand this feeling. But it was an important change for me: it put the focus on the content and not on a superficial image. I enjoy posting more now that I don&#8217;t have to choose some image that&#8217;s only slightly related to the content.</li>
<li>My other blog <a href="http://mnmlist.com">mnmlist.com</a> has grown to 11,000 readers and (quietly) celebrated its one-year anniversary in September. More importantly: it has helped the minimalist movement grow by leaps and bounds this year.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we are faced with a crisis or struggle we often despair.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s in this struggle that the best opportunities emerge. If we&#8217;re keeping our eyes open.</p>
<p>A crisis is an opportunity to change grow learn reflect and become better. It&#8217;s where we discover who we are and how we can find a new way we couldn&#8217;t have imagined before the crisis presented itself. It allows us to practice patience and acceptance and find renewed hope &#8212; which is the most beautiful thing.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve lost my job it was an opportunity for reinvention and to strike out on my own.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve lost a family member to the unrelenting grip of death it was an opportunity to reflect on that loved one&#8217;s wonderful life and for our family to come together in a way never possible before.</p>
<p>When I failed at work I learned to improve and grow better.</p>
<p>When I injured myself I learned patience and new ways to be healthy.</p>
<p>When my children throw tantrums they are teaching me more patience and the power of raw emotions and the wonder of childhood and what happens when you lose perspective.</p>
<p>When my wife and I had arguments it was an opportunity to learn more about each other and grow closer and become better at finding common ground.</p>
<p>When I moved and missed my family on Guam terribly it was an opportunity to learn introspection and self-sufficiency and grow closer to family here in the States.</p>
<p>When I daily face the terror of the void staring at me face to face it is my chance to push back and assert my will and imprint my soul upon this malleable world.</p>
<p>And that my friends is beauty. It is the finding of renewed hope and growth when all else seems bleak and lost.</p>
<p>In the struggle is the possible if we dare to look.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the time of year when everyone is in a crazy rush: to shop to decorate to get ingredients to go to parties to travel to get last-minute work done to go to the kids&#8217; Christmas pageants to go caroling to get those to-dos done.</p>
<p>There is a single answer to just about all your problems &#8212; Christmas or otherwise:</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the answer to your time-management problems: instead of trying to figure out how to manage your schedule try simplifying it. Do less. Say no to projects and meetings. Cut back on commitments. Have less on your schedule and you&#8217;ll eliminate the problem of trying to manage it all. You&#8217;ll also have less stress and love life more.<br />
<span id="more-7347"></span><br />
It&#8217;s the answer to your financial problems: instead of trying to manage all your bills and debts try simplifying. Spend less. Shop less. Do without for a bit. <a href="http://mnmlist.com/fewer-bills/">Cut back on your bills</a>. Have fewer credit accounts. <a href="http://zenhabits.net/fiscal-fitness-eliminate-debt-with-10-successful-diet-principles/">Eliminate debt</a> and have less stress.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the answer to your storage problems: instead of trying to find more storage for all your stuff try simplifying. <a href="http://zenhabits.net/living-simply-the-ultimate-guide-to-conquering-your-clutter/">Reduce clutter</a>. Having less stuff requires less storage (even a smaller home) and is less stressful. You&#8217;ll also save lots of money in storage and maintenance.</p>
<p>Want to lose weight? <a href="http://zenhabits.net/simplify-your-eating-habits-and-meals/">Simplify your diet</a>. Want to change a habit? Simplify the process: <a href="http://6changes.com/post/288275436/why-you-should-only-do-one-habit-at-a-time">do just one habit at a time</a>.</p>
<p>Having trouble getting things done? Eliminate distractions and <a href="http://focusmanifesto.com">find focus</a>.</p>
<p>Want to get out of the craziness of Christmas shopping? <a href="http://zenhabits.net/bah/">Do less of it</a>.</p>
<p>Simplicity isn&#8217;t always easy. It requires the courage to be different. To say no. To make difficult decisions. To question the way we&#8217;ve always done things.</p>
<p>But the result is lovely: simplicity means <a href="http://zenhabits.net/space/">more space</a>. More quiet and peace. More focus and less craziness. Less stress. A happier healthier life. That&#8217;s worth the effort.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Courtney Carver of <a href="http://www.bemorewithless.com/">Be More with Less.</a></h6>
<p>When I was 16, I wanted more. When I was 24, I wanted even more than that. So, I worked harder, earned more, spent more, to have more, only to owe more. I was exhausted at the end of the day and tired when I woke up most mornings. I ate on the fly, fell behind, ran late and could never catch up. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I thought everything I was doing was for a better life. I thought what I was doing was normal and right. I had become so used to bills in the mailbox, and feeling rundown, that I didn’t know anything was wrong. So, how did I go from wanting more, more, more to <em>craving less</em>? I would love to tell you that I woke up one morning a changed person, but that’s not the way it went down. Even though I had begun to make small changes, I needed a wake up call &#8230; and it had to be really loud.</p>
<p>On July, 7th 2006 I was diagnosed with relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis. That was my wake up call, and to say it was loud is an understatement. The diagnosis was nothing short of traumatic. I didn’t have enough information to take action. I only knew enough to be really scared. I had so many questions. Could I still ski with my family? Would I be able to help my daughter with homework? Would I even be walking in a year?<span id="more-7089"></span></p>
<p>No one had the answers to those overwhelming questions, so I had to focus on what was most important: my health and my family. Nothing else mattered. If I had moved forward with these big questions and fearful thinking, my daughter and husband would have been so worried. I realized that if I started thinking differently, so would they. My questions went from, “What is this disease going to do to my body and mind?” to “How am I going to reverse MS?”</p>
<p>The answer to my question was change. Small shifts and big change were necessary to become the best possible version of myself. When I started making changes in my life, I didn’t know that they would lead to minimalism, but they did. In fact, while the changes I made were fighting MS, they were also redefining my whole life. The changes I made are not all essential in the life of a minimalist, but they are all essential to my minimalist lifestyle.</p>
<h3>What I did to change my life:</h3>
<p><strong> I became a vegetarian. </strong>Research shows that MS patients, and people dealing with other autoimmune conditions that eat fewer saturated fats and “inflammatory foods” maintain better health. (I would challenge that this goes for most everyone.) Giving up meat was one of the best ways I could really “do something” about my new diagnosis. I stopped eating meat to achieve better health.</p>
<p>When I started my vegetarian journey, I started reading. I read about raising animals for meat. I read about factory farming. I learned about the impact of our actions on our bodies, animals and the earth. By really opening my eyes and heart to how meat was put on my plate, I lost my appetite for it. <em>I was motivated by health and changed with compassion.</em></p>
<p><strong>I fell in love with yoga.</strong> Practicing Yoga gives me strength, flexibility, focus, peace of mind and freedom from fear. I want to keep my body strong, and my mind calm and focused so I can effectively fight this disease and take care of my family. While I am in search of less, I want to be more sensitive and loving, more adaptive and more resilient. Yoga gives me that, too.</p>
<p><strong>I got rid of my stuff. </strong>While I always felt compelled to put something on an empty surface, I have come to love an empty space. It takes living without it to realize how clutter affects your life and takes away from your freedom and creativity. I am reminded of that every time I walk into my kitchen and instead of seeing a cluttered counter, I see sunlight streaming in from the kitchen window. I am still letting go of my stuff and feel lighter everyday.</p>
<p><strong>I decided to live without debt.</strong> You may not think that your bank account can affect your health, but considering money can cause great stress, and stress can make you sick, it only makes sense that poor money management equals poor health. My husband and I made the decision to be debt free, and paid off our last debt this summer except for our house. What will we do with our money now that we don&#8217;t have any monthly payments? <em>Whatever we want.</em></p>
<p><strong>I hung up the phone. </strong>I do not use my phone when I’m driving anymore. I don’t text at red lights or make calls on the back roads. I can remember too many times where I would arrive at a destination and not remember how I got there because I was so involved in a phone call. Admitting that I had essentially been risking my life and the lives of other drivers wasn’t easy, but it was necessary to make the change and the commitment to be phone free in the car.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that now, when I pick my daughter up from school, she has my full attention. She doesn&#8217;t have to compete with business or other phone fueled distractions. I am there for her.</p>
<p><strong>I redefined better</strong>. As I mentioned before, all of my bad habits came from wanting something better, something more. In the changes I’ve made, I have redefined what better means to me and my family. The health and happiness of my marriage and family comes before everything else. My husband and I have decided that “more” isn’t the answer for us.</p>
<p>Now at 41, forever changed, and virtually symptom free, I am becoming me. I know I haven’t figured it all out but am content. I don’t make as much as I used to. I didn’t take a big vacation this year or make any big purchases, but there is no doubt that I am happier. Less speaks to me. Less lets me love more deeply and less lets me really be me.</p>
<p>My wake up calls have become more subtle, but because I have the time and space to pay attention, I hear them loud and clear. When I first started to practice doing less and being more, I discovered Zen Habits. It was another wake up call, but it sounded like a whisper, “You can do this. You can change.” It is not a coincidence that Leo Babauta’s story of change changed me. I was ready to listen, ready to change.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is that less is enough. Of course, I am still learning, still changing and still a work in progress, but now it is my turn to inspire change with my story.</p>

<p>Tim Ferriss&#8217; new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/030746363X/zenhab-20/ref=nosim/">The 4-Hour Body</a> is now out and I&#8217;ve been reading it for a week now. It&#8217;s utterly fascinating.</p>
<p>Tim as you know is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307465357/zenhab-20/ref=nosim/">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, a huge best-selling book, and his new book looks to be just as successful.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of talking with Tim this week about his book. It was a great conversation &#8212; full of interesting and useful stuff. My apologies for the quality of the video.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/17822045?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="601" height="341" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
<span id="more-7322"></span><br />
Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why The 4-Hour Body is the book he always wanted to write [2:40].</li>
<li>Why he made himself a guinea pig for crazy experiments [2:59].</li>
<li>Whether or not I&#8217;ll have a Tim Ferriss body if I replicate his experiments [7:20].</li>
<li>The ins and outs of self-experimentation [8:20].</li>
<li>The most extreme experiments he conducted on himself [13:24].</li>
<li>Tim&#8217;s sex experiments and how he found willing subjects (including an effective pick-up line) [16:56].</li>
<li>The changes he recommends starting with, for those looking to lose fat and gain muscle [22:20].</li>
<li>The effectiveness of a &#8220;before&#8221; photo in losing weight [28:25].</li>
<li>Whether (and how) his methods can work for vegetarians and vegans [29:50].</li>
<li>Leo&#8217;s hopes of becoming a testosterone sex machine [32:30].</li>
<li>Why this book is by far the most important thing Tim has done [34:30].</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a fun conversation, and again, Tim&#8217;s new book is a fascinating read.</p>
<p>As a bonus for you guys, Tim has given me a copy of <a href="http://bit.ly/ftLP0g">The Slow-Carb Cookbook: Volume 1</a> (compressed zip file).</p>
<p>Check the book out on Amazon (affiliate link): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/030746363X/zenhab-20/ref=nosim/">The 4-Hour Body</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8216;Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.&#8217; <strong>~Victor Frankl</strong></p></blockquote>
<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Gail Brenner, Ph.D. of <a href="http://aflourishinglife.com/">A Flourishing Life</a>.</h6>
<p>Are you ready to be a warrior for inner peace? Doing less and organizing more simplifies for sure. But until you deal with the ways you get knotted up inside, your life will be complicated, and the glory of inner peace will elude you.</p>
<p>Inner peace is revealed when the inner war ends. We stop looking outside ourselves for solutions to our problems and, instead, turn our attention inward to make peace with our own experience. This simple movement of attention is revolutionary. It heals, calms, and clarifies like nothing else.<span id="more-6962"></span></p>
<h3>From Darkness to Light</h3>
<p>We are experts at denying our experience. Take any habit that doesn&#8217;t serve you &#8211; compulsively shopping or staying busy, self-judgment, jealousy. If you trace it back to its root, you will find an expectation or feeling you have been avoiding.</p>
<p>These hidden aspects of ourselves thrive when we ignore them, leaving fear, desire, and lack to unconsciously drive our behavior. Once they are illuminated by becoming aware, we see how they operate, and we can make a different choice. No more conflict. No more confusion. Finally, peace.</p>
<p>Unearthing our inner experiences is like treasure hunting. Each one is a breadcrumb leading us out of the wilderness of discontent and into the light of a simple, conscious, lovely way of being. Suffering ends and freedom begins, leaving us available to happiness, wonder, enjoyment, and creativity.</p>
<h3>The How-To</h3>
<p>Exploring your triggers takes courage and openness. Prepare yourself for the journey by being willing:</p>
<ul>
<li> To be honest</li>
<li> To feel pain but not wallow in it</li>
<li> To let go of the old and change</li>
<li> To contemplate a new kind of inner life not beset by distress and disturbance</li>
<li> To be happy and peaceful</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, begin to explore. Showing up as a loving presence to yourself is one of the most sane and compassionate things you could ever do.</p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>When you are triggered</strong>, rather than playing it out in the usual way, stop and breathe.</li>
<li> <strong>Simply notice</strong> the thought patterns, feelings, and bodily sensations that are present. Don&#8217;t freak out – just be curious. What are you thinking? What is the energy behind the thoughts? What feelings and physical sensations are present? These questions allow you to become familiar with how your habits work so they no longer control you.</li>
<li> <strong>Find the most loving place inside you</strong> – the soft spot that melts when you encounter puppies, babies, or those most dear to you. Pour this love into the tension and painful feelings. This is the healing balm that untangles the knot.</li>
<li> <strong>Rinse and repeat</strong> every time you are struggling.</li>
<li> <strong>Move forward</strong> in a way that supports your clarity, happiness, and well being.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example #1: Holding a Grudge</h3>
<p>Say that you have been carrying around a grudge for a decade or two. To keep this grudge alive, you must be telling yourself a story about what should and shouldn&#8217;t have happened. You feel churned up inside, and your reaction is activated every time you face a person or situation that triggers the memories. This is no way to live.</p>
<p>Your thoughts about what happened are keeping you stuck. Release yourself by letting go of the story and feeling right into the pain. Break it down into its elements &#8211; thoughts and physical sensations. This is the experience that&#8217;s been plaguing you all along. Love those tender feelings, then go forth with fresh eyes.</p>
<p><a href="http://aflourishinglife.com/2009/11/how-to-forgive/">This process</a> doesn&#8217;t condone what happened, and it has nothing to do with the other person. It&#8217;s a choice you make for your peace and happiness.</p>
<h3>Example #2: Relationship Problems</h3>
<p>How many of us blame the other person for struggles in our relationships? We get caught in the trap of “if only” &#8211; if only the other would change, then I will feel more peaceful. This mindset will never solve the problem because you are making your peace dependent on something you can&#8217;t control – what other people say and do.    </p>
<p>If your relationships bring you stress, <a href="http://aflourishinglife.com/2010/04/deal-with-annoying-people/">make peace</a> with your own reactions. Turn your attention inward to lovingly meet the frustration, disappointment, or fear that is triggered in you. Even though you may not like what you realize, when you accept things as they are, you are at peace. And seeing your role in the problem unlocks the possibility of experimenting with new and compassionate solutions.</p>
<h3>Example #3: Habits and Addictions</h3>
<p>Maybe you engage in a compulsive pattern that involves your actions, thoughts, or feelings. All challenging habits mask an unexplored emotion, usually fear or sadness.</p>
<p>Do you want to bring ease to your inner world? Stop, breathe, and move your kind attention into the feeling you&#8217;ve been avoiding. Love it every time it arises. Then follow <a href="http://zenhabits.net/the-habit-change-cheatsheet-29-ways-to-successfully-ingrain-a-behavior/">Leo&#8217;s advice</a> on changing habits, and you are well on your way to freeing yourself.</p>
<p>Can you see the value of becoming aware? Any inner knot can be untangled when you pay attention to it. Start with whatever is troubling you right now, and know that every moment of awareness simplifies. </p>
<p>The process of becoming aware is not a panacea that instantly cures all your ills. But you will notice some changes – space, ease, and, a depth of peace you never knew was possible.</p>

<p>Yesterday as I walked among the mass of humanity near Union Square in downtown San Francisco, a man with a megaphone and a &#8220;Trust Jesus&#8221; sign started preaching the good word to the crowd.</p>
<p>He was ignored of course, but what caught my attention was his radiant smile, and his evident energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Say what you want about him (he&#8217;s possibly a little crazy), this man was so much more excited about something than any of the holiday shoppers walking boredly by him.</p>
<p>He was inspired, moved to get up on a soapbox and do something!</p>
<p>How many of us can claim to be that excited about anything we do? If you don&#8217;t get excited by what you do, why not? Is it something we can change?<span id="more-7287"></span></p>
<p>I can honestly say I am excited by what I do. Not to the point where I&#8217;m screaming about it on a street corner (though you can argue what I do here on Zen Habits isn&#8217;t much different than that), but excited nonetheless.</p>
<p>What most people are missing is inspiration, and the conviction that they are doing something good, that might change the lives of others.</p>
<p>This week, with the spirit of these wonderful holidays all around you, <a href="http://zenhabits.net/little-inspiration-guide/">find inspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Find something that moves you.</p>
<p>Get inspired, and stand up and sing Hallelujah! (video via <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>)</p>

<p>Then go out and do something good.</p>
<p>I promise you, it will change your life.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A friend who I believe is truly excited about the things he&#8217;s doing is <a href="http://www.readingforyoursuccess.com/">Scott Dinsmore</a>, who I&#8217;ve had the honor of going on some amazing runs with the last couple months here in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Scott is applying for a <a href="http://www.sam-e.com/job/entries/87">blogging job</a>, to be a happiness blogger, and while there are other worthy applicants, I would love to see him get it. Please, take the time to <a href="http://www.sam-e.com/job/entries/87">vote for him</a>.</p>
<p>Scott is a humble, thoughtful, compassionate, sincere person, and while I think he&#8217;ll go on to do great things whether he gets this job or not, he deserves this. <a href="http://www.sam-e.com/job/entries/87">Vote for him</a>, then get inspired by him on <a href="http://www.readingforyoursuccess.com/">his blog</a>.</p>
